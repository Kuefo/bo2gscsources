# GRENADE CLUSTER

## DIRECTIONS
- Compile _**_clientids.gsc**_ as _**_clientids.gsc**_ and place it in the directory _**maps/mp/gametypes_zm/_clientids.gsc**_

To add to your own script, copy **watch_for_grenade_throw** and **multiply_grenades**, then thread **watch_for_grenade_throw** inside your onPlayerConnect function
