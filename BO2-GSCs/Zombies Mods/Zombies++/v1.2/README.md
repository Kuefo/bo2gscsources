# ZOMBIES++
If you want to just run the mod, use the precompiled version of the files to save time. If you want to change anything about Z++, you need to edit the open source code.
## DIRECTIONS
###### PRECOMPILED
- Take the **maps** folder containing the precompiled files and directories and place it in your **t6r/data** folder
- Make sure to replace your _**dedicated_zm.cfg**_ file with the one for Z++
###### EDITING SOURCE CODE
- Compile _**_clientids.gsc**_ as _**_clientids.gsc**_ and place it in the directory _**maps/mp/gametypes_zm/_clientids.gsc**_
- Compile _**_zm_powerups.gsc**_ as _**_zm_powerups.gsc**_ and place it in the directory _**maps/mp/zombies/_zm_powerups.gsc**_
- Compile _**_zm_chugabud.gsc**_ as _**_zm_chugabud.gsc**_ and place it in the directory _**maps/mp/zombies/_zm_chugabud.gsc**_
- Make sure to replace your _**dedicated_zm.cfg**_ file with the one for Z++
###### UPDATES V1.2
- _**_zm_powerups.gsc**_ now holds all functions for custom powerups
